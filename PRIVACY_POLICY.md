# Privacy Policy for SmartHR FanControl

**Last updated: October 30, 2025**

Thank you for using SmartHR FanControl. Your privacy is critically important to us. This document outlines our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data.

### 1. Data Collection and Use

This application is a hobby project and operates on a principle of **zero data collection**. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal or usage data to the developer or any third party. The application does not contain advertisements or any form of analytics tracking.

### 2. Data Storage and Security

To function, the application requires you to provide sensitive information, such as your fan's IP address and token, as well as the MAC addresses of your Bluetooth heart rate sensors. All of this data is stored **exclusively on your device**. We use Android's Jetpack Security library (EncryptedSharedPreferences) to encrypt this data, ensuring it is protected and inaccessible to other applications. No data ever leaves your phone.

### 3. Heart Rate (Biometric) Data

The application receives heart rate data from your chosen Bluetooth sensor in real-time to control your fan. This biometric data is processed **entirely on your device** and is **never stored, logged, or transmitted** off your device by the application.

The "Heart Rate Sharing" feature allows you to re-broadcast your heart rate as a standard Bluetooth HR peripheral. Enabling this feature is your choice and responsibility. The application only facilitates this broadcast; it does not monitor or record where this data is sent.

### 4. Permissions

The application requires certain permissions to function (e.g., Wi-Fi and Bluetooth access). These permissions are used **exclusively for the application's core functionality**: discovering and communicating with your HR sensor and fan, and optionally, re-broadcasting your heart rate.

### 5. Third-Party Services

The application includes a link to "Buy Me a Coffee" for voluntary support. If you choose to use this link, you will be redirected to a third-party website. Your interaction with that website is governed by their own privacy policy and terms of service.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the application.
